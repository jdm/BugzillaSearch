BugzillaSearch
==============

Mozilla has a publicly accessible ElasticSearch cluster filled with all
Bugzilla's public bugs [[read more](https://wiki.mozilla.org/BMO/ElasticSearch)].
This cluster is updated every 10 minutes, so it is not too far behind.

This is a simple, and silly, page to demonstrate the text searching
capabilities of ElasticSearch.

Over the past year, my professional effrot has gone into using this cluster,
and others, as a data warehouse; and ElasticSearch has proven to be very
performant for this task.   But, I have never had the opportunity to use
ElasticSearch for what it was designed for - Searching documents!

This weekend I made a silly static page to demonstrate how the cluster can be
used.
